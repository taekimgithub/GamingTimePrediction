    "After a multivariate regression model was trained on the players.csv dataset, we found that the model explains a mere 3.07% of the variance in played_hours (R squared = 0.0307). The rmse of 1.048 indicates that model predictions are on average 1.048 hours off from the true values. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these metrics indicate the age has a very weak relationship with total hours played, when we plot the observations we do find a weak negative relationship. Younger people tend to play more. However, this may be due to a lack of observations for people of higher age. \n",
